## Secora APII – Data Analytics Internship  
**Project: One-Page Asset Management Plan (AMP) Dashboard**

### Problem Statement
Secora uses a Lifecycle Management Metric (LMM) dashboard to monitor asset health and financial risk across portfolios. While effective at a high level, the LMM dashboard primarily provides portfolio-level insights through clustered visuals and heatmaps, making it difficult for stakeholders to:

1. Drill down into individual asset performance  
2. Quickly assess asset-specific risk, cost, and maintenance status  
3. Make fast, actionable decisions without navigating multiple reports  

Asset managers required a concise, asset-level view that could translate complex operational and financial data into a single, interpretable screen to support risk-based planning and decision-making.

---

### Solution
Designed and delivered a dynamic, one-page Asset Management Plan (AMP) dashboard that:

1. Translates LMM data into clear, asset-level insights  
2. Consolidates cost, condition, outages, maintenance, and capital planning into a single view  
3. Uses a reusable and scalable architecture applicable across asset types  

Validated across three asset categories: Drill (fixed plant), Crane (infrastructure), and Truck (mobile equipment).

### What I Did
1. Extracted and restructured asset-level data from the existing LMM dashboard  
2. Cleaned and modelled data to enable dynamic filtering and logic-driven insights  
3. Designed a fixed, one-page dashboard layout to ensure consistency and reusability  
4. Built interactive Power BI visuals, including:  
   - Lifecycle cost KPIs  
   - Risk and vulnerability gauges with threshold-based logic  
   - Defect and outage matrices
   - Maintenance cost and effort breakdowns
5. Developed DAX-driven executive summaries using WHAT – SO WHAT – NOW WHAT logic  
6. Validated dashboards through stakeholder demonstrations and incorporated feedback

### Tools & Technologies
Power BI, DAX, Excel, Asset lifecycle & risk management concepts

---

### Outcome
1. Delivered three fully dynamic, one-page AMP dashboards  
2. Enabled faster asset reviews and clearer, risk-based decision-making  
3. Reduced reporting duplication through a scalable, filter-driven design

### Confidentiality Note
I cannot attach the dashboard link. I have attached a sample dashboard for a Drill asset in the deliverables report and presentation. All visuals update automatically based on the selected asset. Some details have been hidden for confidentiality.

Please note that the actual working dashboard cannot be shown here, as it was developed within the client’s environment.
